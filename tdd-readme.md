###  test-driven development (TDD)

__Test-driven development was introduced as part of a larger software design paradigm known as Extreme Programming (XP), which is part of the Agile software development methodology.__

###What it solves?

- Test-driven development is a process of modifying the code in order to pass a test designed previously.
- It more emphasis on production code rather than test case design.
- In Software Engineering, It is sometimes known as "Test First Development."
- TDD includes refactoring a code i.e. changing/adding some amount of code to the existing code without affecting the behavior of the code.
- TDD when used, the code becomes clearer and simple to understand.


###How to perform TDD Test

Following steps define how to perform TDD test,

- Add a test.
- Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
- Write some code.
- Run tests and Refactor code.
- Repeat.

###TDD cycle defines
- Write a test
- Make it run.
- Change the code to make it right i.e. Refactor.
- Repeat process.
